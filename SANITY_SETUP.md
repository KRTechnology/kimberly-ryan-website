# Sanity CMS Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and configure Sanity CMS for your Kimberly-Ryan website with **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** and **on-demand revalidation**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Create a Sanity Account and Project

1. Go to [sanity.io](https://sanity.io) and sign up/log in
2. Create a new project:

   ```bash
   npx sanity@latest init
   ```

   Or create a project directly on [sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage)

3. Note down your **Project ID** and **Dataset** (usually 'production')

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
# Sanity Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production

# Sanity Studio Configuration (for studio access)
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here

# Webhook Secret for security (generate a random string)
SANITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secure_webhook_secret_here
```

To get your API token:

1. Go to [sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "API" tab
4. Create a new token with "Editor" permissions

### 3. Access Sanity Studio

Once you've set up your environment variables, you can access the Sanity Studio in two ways:

#### Option A: Embedded Studio (Recommended)

Visit `http://localhost:3000/studio` when running your Next.js development server.

#### Option B: Standalone Studio

Run the standalone studio:

```bash
npm run studio
```

## ‚ö° Real-time Content Updates

This website now uses **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** combined with **webhooks** for instant content updates without requiring redeployments.

### How It Works

1. **ISR**: Pages automatically revalidate every 60 seconds for blog content
2. **Webhooks**: Sanity notifies your website immediately when content is published/updated
3. **Cache Tags**: Granular cache invalidation for efficient updates

### Setting Up Webhooks in Sanity

1. Go to your Sanity project dashboard at [sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **API** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
4. Click **"Create webhook"**
5. Configure the webhook:

   ```
   Name: Next.js Revalidation
   URL: https://yourdomain.com/api/revalidate
   Dataset: production
   Trigger on: Create, Update, Delete
   HTTP method: POST
   HTTP Headers:
     x-sanity-webhook-secret: your_secure_webhook_secret_here

   Include drafts: No
   ```

6. **Projection** (filter what data to send):

   ```json
   {
     "_type": _type,
     "slug": slug,
     "_id": _id
   }
   ```

7. Save the webhook

### Testing the Webhook

Test your webhook endpoint:

```bash
# Test if the endpoint is active
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/revalidate

# Or locally during development
curl http://localhost:3000/api/revalidate
```

### Content Update Flow

1. **Publish a blog post** in Sanity Studio
2. **Webhook triggers** immediately
3. **Cache invalidated** for affected pages
4. **New content appears** on your website within seconds

Images are automatically optimized using Sanity's image transformation API through the `urlFor()` helper function.

### Rich Text Content

Blog post content uses Sanity's Portable Text format, which is rendered using the `@portabletext/react` component.

## üìù Form Data Collection

The website includes comprehensive form data collection using Sanity for both contact forms and newsletter subscriptions.

### Contact Form Submissions

Contact form data is automatically stored in Sanity with the following structure:

- **Schema**: `contactSubmission`

  - **Privacy Policy Agreement**: Required checkbox
  - **Submission Date**: Auto-generated timestamp
  - **Status**: New, In Progress, Responded, Closed
  - **Source**: Website (auto-populated)
  - **Internal Notes**: For team reference

**Status Management**: New submissions are marked as "new" and can be updated to "in_progress", "responded", or "closed" for tracking purposes.

### Newsletter Subscriptions

Newsletter subscription data is stored with duplicate prevention:

- **Schema**: `newsletterSubscription`
- **Fields**:
  - **Email**: Required, validated email format
  - **Subscription Date**: Auto-generated timestamp
  - **Status**: Active, Unsubscribed, Bounced
  - **Source**: Website Footer, Gallery Page, Contact Page, Homepage, Other

### Accessing Form Data in Sanity Studio

1. Navigate to your Sanity Studio at `yourdomain.com/studio`
2. Look for "Contact Form Submissions" and "Newsletter Subscriptions" in the sidebar
3. View, filter, and manage submissions directly in the Studio interface
4. Use the built-in ordering options:
   - **Contact Submissions**: By submission date (newest first) or by status
   - **Newsletter Subscriptions**: By subscription date, status, or email alphabetically

### Form Submission Features

- **Real-time Feedback**: Users see immediate feedback when submitting forms
- **Loading States**: Visual indicators during form submission
- **Success/Error Messages**: Clear messaging for all submission states
- **Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation for data integrity
- **Responsive Design**: Forms work beautifully on all devices

### API Functions

The following helper functions are available for form submissions:

```javascript

  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  phone: "+1234567890",
  howDidYouHear: "Google Search",
  serviceInterested: "HR Advisory services",

});

if (result.success) {
  console.log("Form submitted successfully");
} else {
  console.error("Form submission failed:", result.error);
}

// Newsletter subscription
import { submitNewsletterSubscription } from "@/lib/sanity";

const result = await submitNewsletterSubscription({
  email: "john@example.com",
  source: "website_footer",
});

if (result.success) {
  if (result.reactivated) {
    console.log("Subscription reactivated");
  } else {
    console.log("New subscription created");
  }
} else {
  console.error("Subscription failed:", result.error);
}
```

## üõ† Development Workflow

### 1. Local Development

```bash
# Start Next.js development server
npm run dev

# Access your website at http://localhost:3000
# Access Sanity Studio at http://localhost:3000/studio
```

### 2. Content Updates

1. Make content changes in the Studio
2. **Publish** the content (don't just save as draft)
3. Webhook triggers automatically
4. Changes appear on your website within seconds

### 3. Schema Changes

If you need to modify content schemas:

1. Edit files in `sanity/schemas/`
2. Restart your development server
3. The Studio will reflect the new schema

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### 1. Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your production environment:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
SANITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

### 2. Studio Access

Your production Sanity Studio will be available at `yourdomain.com/studio`.

### 3. Webhook Configuration

Update the webhook URL in Sanity to point to your production domain:

```
https://yourdomain.com/api/revalidate
```

### 4. Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Sanity uses a global CDN for fast content delivery. Your content will be cached and served efficiently worldwide.

## üìä Performance & Caching

### ISR Benefits

- **Instant updates**: New content appears without redeployment
- **Performance**: Static pages with dynamic updates
- **SEO-friendly**: Pre-rendered content for search engines
- **Scalable**: Handle traffic spikes efficiently

### Cache Invalidation

The system uses both:

- **Time-based revalidation**: Pages refresh automatically

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Content Not Updating Immediately

1. **Check webhook status** in Sanity dashboard
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Ensure content is published** (not just saved as draft)
4. **Check webhook logs** in your hosting platform
5. **Test the webhook endpoint** using curl

### Webhook Not Triggering

1. **Verify webhook URL** is accessible from external requests
2. **Check webhook secret** matches your environment variable
3. **Review webhook configuration** in Sanity dashboard
4. **Check server logs** for webhook errors

### Studio Not Loading

- Check your environment variables
- Ensure your Project ID and Dataset are correct
- Verify your API token has the right permissions

### Build Errors
