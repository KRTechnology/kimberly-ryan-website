# Sanity CMS Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and configure Sanity CMS for your Kimberly-Ryan website.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Create a Sanity Account and Project

1. Go to [sanity.io](https://sanity.io) and sign up/log in
2. Create a new project:

   ```bash
   npx sanity@latest init
   ```

   Or create a project directly on [sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage)

3. Note down your **Project ID** and **Dataset** (usually 'production')

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
# Sanity Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production

# Sanity Studio Configuration (for studio access)
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
```

To get your API token:

1. Go to [sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "API" tab
4. Create a new token with "Editor" permissions

### 3. Access Sanity Studio

Once you've set up your environment variables, you can access the Sanity Studio in two ways:

#### Option A: Embedded Studio (Recommended)

Visit `http://localhost:3000/studio` when running your Next.js development server.

#### Option B: Standalone Studio

Run the standalone studio:

```bash
npm run studio
```

## üîÑ How It Works

### Data Fetching

The website uses several helper functions in `lib/sanity.ts`:

- `getBlogPosts()`: Fetches all blog posts
- `getBlogPost(slug)`: Fetches a single blog post by slug
- `getGalleryItems()`: Fetches all gallery items
- `getCategories()`: Fetches all categories
- `getAuthors()`: Fetches all authors

### Image Optimization

Images are automatically optimized using Sanity's image transformation API through the `urlFor()` helper function.

### Rich Text Content

Blog post content uses Sanity's Portable Text format, which is rendered using the `@portabletext/react` component.

## üõ† Development Workflow

### 1. Local Development

```bash
# Start Next.js development server
npm run dev

# Access your website at http://localhost:3000
# Access Sanity Studio at http://localhost:3000/studio
```

### 2. Content Updates

1. Make content changes in the Studio
2. Changes are automatically synced
3. Your website will fetch the latest content

### 3. Schema Changes

If you need to modify content schemas:

1. Edit files in `sanity/schemas/`
2. Restart your development server
3. The Studio will reflect the new schema

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### 1. Environment Variables

Make sure to set the same environment variables in your production environment.

### 2. Studio Access

Your production Sanity Studio will be available at `yourdomain.com/studio`.

### 3. Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Sanity uses a global CDN for fast content delivery. Your content will be cached and served efficiently worldwide.
